When summer returns to its warm green fields
The sun fading, pastel in the breeze
The swallow swooping, migrating home
The dawning days morning with a sigh
Opening windows with a wounding cry
The rainbow's lost its dreams of gold
And everything slows

When summer returns to its warm green fields
The sun fading, pastel in the breeze
The swallow swooping, migrating home
And everything slows

The vacuum draws you in
Strange visions are loose on white
A wall of sound with flutes and strings
Rising on a wave of voices
Surrounded by your humble faith
Morning's there to wake us in time
Rain and sky
The world is breathing, living, but turning in its rage

When summer returns to its warm green fields
Everything slows
The sun fading, pastel in the breeze
Everything slows
The swallow swooping, migrating home
Everything slows
